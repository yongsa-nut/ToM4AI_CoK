    "\n",
    "### 1. GPT-5 Shows Partial Understanding of Curse-of-Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT-5 demonstrates awareness of the curse-of-knowledge mechanism through \"reality bias\" reasoning:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Framing Type | GPT-5-low | GPT-5-medium | GPT-5-high |\n",
    "|--------------|-----------|--------------|------------|\n",
    "| Reality-bias (\"they know where it is\", \"reality bias\") | 20.8% | 14.6% | 14.4% |\n",
    "| Position-tracking (\"Alice might track location\") | 36.4% | 31.5% | 30.0% |\n",
    "| Research citations (\"studies show 80-90%\") | 45.5% | 61.8% | 57.8% |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight:** GPT-5 DOES recognize that participants' knowledge of reality can bias their predictions (reality-bias framing ~15-21%). This IS the curse-of-knowledge mechanism. However, it never uses the term \"curse of knowledge\" explicitly (0 mentions).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Heavy Reliance on Memorized Research\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT-5 frequently cites false-belief research, stating that \"studies show 80-90% choose the original container\":\n",
    "\n",
    "> *\"Research suggests adults choose the original container correctly about 80-90%\"*\n",
    ">\n",
    "> *\"Classic tasks show high accuracy for initial container beliefs\"*\n",
    ">\n",
    "> *\"Previous studies, like the Sally-Anne task, show similar results\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "**The problem:** Those studies typically use 2-container setups (Sally-Anne), not 4-container layouts like our experiment. GPT-5 may be overfitting/memorizing from literature rather than reasoning from first principles about this specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Competing Framings for Why Red Gets Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT-5 offers two different explanations for why participants might choose red:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reality-bias (curse of knowledge):** \"Some might pick red because they know the violin was moved\" ✓\n",
    "2. **Position-tracking (Alice's confusion):** \"Alice might track location instead of color\" ✗\n",
    "\n",
    "The position-tracking explanation is technically wrong—it attributes the bias to Alice's potential confusion, not to participants' knowledge contamination. But both framings lead to assigning some probability to red.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Reasoning Effort Gradient\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher reasoning effort = more stable predictions:\n",

    "| Model | K-I Std | K-I Min | K-I Outliers |\n",
    "|-------|---------|---------|--------------|\n",
    "| GPT-5-low | 14.9% | 17% | 5 (5.6%) |\n",

    "| GPT-5-high | 5.0% | 65% | 0 (0.0%) |\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Position-Tracking Creates Variance Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "Position-tracking reasoning creates outliers primarily in K-Implausible because position and reality CONFLICT:\n",

    "| Condition | Position = Reality? | Outliers (GPT-5-low) |\n",
    "|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|\n",

    "| K-Implausible | NO (conflict) | 5 (5.6%) |\n",
    "\n",
    "When GPT-5-low fully commits to position-tracking in K-I, it gives 65-70% to RED (leftmost after swap), which inflates K-I red and erases the plausibility effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Standard Curse-of-Knowledge Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Ryskin 2014 measures:\n",

    "\n",
    "### 7. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **GPT-5 partially understands curse-of-knowledge** through \"reality bias\" framing (~15-21% of trials), recognizing that participants' knowledge of reality can bias predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Heavy reliance on memorized research** (~45-62% cite studies) — GPT-5 anchors on \"80-90% choose original container\" from the literature, but those studies use simpler 2-container setups\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Competing framings coexist:** Reality-bias (correct mechanism) and position-tracking (wrong attribution) both appear in reasoning, sometimes in the same trial\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Higher reasoning effort improves stability** without changing conceptual framing — GPT-5-high hedges better, treating alternative explanations as minority factors\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Position-tracking variance** is a secondary issue that primarily affects GPT-5-low in K-Implausible, erasing the plausibility effect through inflated K-I red values"
